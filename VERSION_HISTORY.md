# FX Command Agents — Version History

Every system version, what changed, and how to revert. From v13 onward each
version is a **git tag** — revert with `git checkout <tag>` (or
`git checkout -b rollback-<tag> <tag>` to branch from it). Versions v3–v12
predate git; their snapshots live in `Archive/` (not in git — old configs
contain secrets).

**Rule: `config.py` is never committed** (live Telegram + Anthropic keys).
Parameter changes are recorded in this file's notes instead.

### v13 promotions (config.py — untracked; recorded here per the config-is-never-committed rule)
Added to `KIRA_ROUTING_TABLE`, `ENGINE_SYMBOL_WHITELIST`, and `PAIRS`/`JPY_PAIRS`:
- **CBE × CADJPY** — matrix PF 3.40, OOS +RM298 (4/5 folds). Strongest.
- **CTE × USDCHF** — matrix PF 2.19, OOS +RM68 (4/5 folds).
- **MRE × EURGBP** — matrix PF 2.17, OOS +RM81 (4/5 folds).
- **CBE × EURGBP** — matrix PF 1.76, OOS +RM51 (3/5 folds).

Held (net-positive but not promoted this round): CBE×AUDJPY (OOS 2/4 folds), CTE×XAGUSD (unstable PF 1.26→1.95 across runs, whitelisted only 1/4 OOS folds, unresolved Silver pip-value uncertainty). Rejected: CBE×NZDJPY (in-sample PF 1.79 but OOS-NEGATIVE −RM18.73 — the walk-forward curve-fit catch). No GVE/HPE variant promoted (SELL/NY all failed). "Probation" is a monitoring convention only — no coded 0.5× sizing mechanism exists. To revert: remove the four `# v13` entries from config.py and `git checkout v12` for tracked files.

**Open items for a future session:** (1) two currently-live combos now FAIL the matrix — CBE×NZDUSD (PF 1.20) and CTE×NZDUSD (PF 1.18); NOT auto-demoted (v10 lesson: don't re-filter on one window; ATLAS alpha-decay brake is the designed mechanism) — monitor in SIM. (2) XAGUSD GVE-scan and config.py still carry the naive pip_val (10× oversized) — fix before any Silver retry. (3) 51 non-FX markets surfaced by the scan await a new-engine spec.

## Naming note

"GVE v12" is the Gold Volatility Engine's **internal** version number (39
signals, WR 69.2%, PF 1.90) and is unrelated to system v12. Always say
"system vN" or "GVE vN".

## Changelog discipline (from v13 onward)

1. Every meaningful change = a git commit with a message explaining *why*.
2. Every completed system version = a git tag `vN` + a row in the table above.
3. Performance numbers in the table come from `backtest_master_v13.py` (or
   its successor) runs — never estimates.
4. Live-config promotions (whitelist/routing changes) are listed explicitly
   in the version's notes, since `config.py` itself is untracked.
